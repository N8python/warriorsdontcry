            body: `
        <p>Born on Pearl Harbor Day, December 7, 1941, Melba grew up in Little Rock Arkansas with her father, Howell, her mother, Lois, her brother, Conrad, and her grandma, India.  Melba is the author and the main protagonist of <em>Warriors Don't Cry</em>, and a starkly dynamic character throughout the book.</p>

    <p>Initially, Melba is optimistic about the results of integration, hoping that the white racists will change their opinions upon seeing that Melba is a genuinely good person who means no harm. Upon arrival, however, The Little Rock Nine are heckled ruthlessly, and a group of crazed white men chases and attempt to hang Melba. During Melba's first day at school, she is teased and abused (both physically and verbally) by both students and teachers.</p>

    <p>After this initial defeat, Melba and her family are discouraged and worries that the risk of attending Central High might outweigh the benefits. However, Grandma India gives Melba a pep talk, and tells her that "God's warriors don't cry." Gradually, Melba regains her confidence and she continues to attend Central High. Progress is made in increments over the course of the year, and while the white students never stop heckling the Little Rock Nine, the incidents become slightly less frequent.</p>

    <p>By the end of the book, Melba has realized that while integrating Central High will not immediately result in equality for her, the Little Rock Nine, and all African Americans in general, it is an important step in the right direction - any change has a significant impact.</p>

    <p>After the events of the book, Melba graduated from San Francisco State University and went on to earn a master's degree in journalism and she promptly became a journalist. She married John Beals, and they had one daughter before getting divorced. Today, Melba remains a journalist and is the retired chairman of the Dominican University of California's Communications Department. She will be forever honored for her bravery in the integration of Central High, and her contribution to the Civil Rights movement.</p>

        <p>Conrad is a minor supporting character in <em>Warriors Don't Cry</em>. While the entirety of his character is not fully fleshed out in the novel, he seems like a playful and enthusiastic soul. He is present for the scene in which Melba is raped, where he is playing with his friend Clark. In addition, he has a minor speaking role where he reveals that he is under the misconception that Melba "likes suffering and doing without" because she goes to Central High. When Mother Lois asks why he thinks that, Conrad responds that Clark told him. He is swiftly corrected and informed of Melba's determination and perseverance at Central High. The significance of this line is embodied in Clark's spreading of misinformation about Melba's motives - and in general, shows how some African Americans aren't completely on board with integration (mainly due to fear.)</p>

She is the Matriarch of Melba's family, provides income through her work as a maid, and serves as a voice of reason and support to Melba. Grandma India's top priority is Melba's safety, and she intelligently prohibits Melba from leaving the house during the first days of integration at Central High because crazed racists may be stalking her, just waiting for the right moment to pounce and kill Melba.</p>
        <p>When Melba becomes disheartened and beings to cry as integration at Central High confines her to her house, Grandma India tells Melba "You'll make this your last cry. You're a warrior on the battlefield for your Lord. God's warriors don't cry, 'cause  they trust that he's always on their side." When Melba is running, terrified, from racist white women blinded by rage, she remembers Grandma India's words of wisdom: "God never loses one of his flock." Then, Melba regains her composure and safely makes it back to her school guide.</p>
        <p>For the reasons listed above and for all the other brave and supportive actions Grandma India takes throughout the story, Melba looks up to her with respect and admiration.</p>`

Howell is a strong, stout man who Melba initially admires as a father figure. One of Melba's first exposures to segregation was in Mr. Waylan's grocery store, where Melba's family was overcharged twenty-two dollars (several hundred dollars in today's money.) Melba's father, though he was stronger, taller, and more powerful than an old decrepit white man running the cashier, couldn't stand up for his family out of fear of the repercussions. Once her parents get divorced, Howell still visits on occasion, and Melba hopes for a few years that her parents will get back together before she finally accepts the fact of their separation.</p>"

While their relationship is not explored as much as Melba's relationship with Grandma India, Lois does play an important role in Melba's attitude towards her attendance of Central High.</p>
            <p>Mother Lois is a teacher herself - she teaches 7th grade English. So, when she gets the news that Melba is going to Central High, she is initially concerned for Melba's well being, so much so that she pushes Melba towards her car and tells Melba to save herself as the angry mob of white men chases them down. Furthermore, after Melba is verbally and physically abused on her first day at Central High, Mother Lois and Melba both begin to feel like going to Central High was a mistake. However, Grandma India remains determined, and by the middle of the book, Mother Lois is firmly in support of Melba's decision to go to Central High, and she takes it extremely seriously. When Melba makes an offhand joke about integration at a Thanksgiving gathering, she tells Melba "You'll live to regret that statement." Ultimately, Melba's mother plays a serious and supportive role in helping Melba with the integration of Central High.</p>`

She went on to become ever more involved in the Civil Rights Movement, associating with leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. and the NAACP itself. After she finally retired from work, she wrote her autobiography and continued to push for Civil Rights and equality for all, making the point that the fight for an end to racism was far from over.

Eventually, the issue of integration in Arkansas went to court, and after Faubus's prosecution walked out of the courtroom, judge Robert Davies ruled in favor of integration. President Eisenhower later sent in the 101st Airborne Division to protect the Little Rock Nine, and Faubus's hopes of segregation were foiled. However, to strike back, Faubus shut down all high schools in Little Rock for the 1958-1959 school year.

He's so charismatic that even when Melba disagrees with him she says she "likes his attitude". He testifies in court to defend integration (along with Elizabeth Eckford) and with the help of Thurgood Marshall and Wiley Branton, The Little Rock Nine win the case.

She attempted to enter Central High on her own and was swiftly surrounded by rabid segregationists, heckling and striking her. A white teenager named Hazel Bryan approached and started screaming at her. All the while Elizabeth kept her composure.

            Born in 1941, Minnijean Brown is one of Melba's closest friends in Warriors Don't Cry, along with a member of the Little Rock Nine. Melba and Minnijean had many things in common, and these shared interests (singing and "worship of Johnny Mathis", among others) were some of the cornerstones of their friendship. As the book progresses, the taunting, abuse, and isolation that come with attending Central High begin to get to her. She becomes "especially vulnerable", according to Melba, and she "was almost obsessed with finding an opportunity to perform her music on stage," perhaps hoping that once the white students heard her beautiful voice, they would have a bit more respect for her.
          </p>
          <p>Later in the year, Minnijean is expelled from Central High due to a series of "incidents", none of which were initiated by Minnijean. The first incident occurs (The "Minnijean Chili Scene") when Minnijean is being harassed and pushed around by two white boys at lunch, and she is so fed up with not being allowed to defend herself from her white tormentors that she drops her chili she is carrying on the boy's heads, and she is promptly suspended for six days. Then, in February, a group of racist white students launch a coordinated attack on Minnijean, and to retaliate, she rightfully calls the girls "white trash". She is promptly expelled. This leads to the circulation of the message "One down, eight to go." in Central High. Minnijean attends New Lincoln School in New York for the remainder of her high school education and goes to college at Southern Illinois University, before studying social work and ultimately working at the Clinton Administration.</p>`

She later founded LaNeir and Company, where she started her career as a real estate broker.

She later graduated from the Illinois Institute of Technology before moving to Sweden, where she took up work as a patent attorney.

Several chapters in, her dreams become a reality when Vince flat-out asks her to be his girlfriend. Their first date goes well, with Melba accompanying Vince to church and lunch, and concludes with Vince and Melba having dinner with the entirety of Melba's family. When no one else shows up to Melba's birthday party out of fear that Melba's house will be attacked, Vince attends and gives Melba "tiny gold hoop earrings". Vince later becomes a regular guest Melba's family's Sunday dinners.</p>
            <p>Though their relationship gets off to a good start, Melba gets so caught up in the integration of Central High that she gradually begins to feel like she doesn't have time for a boyfriend. Soon, she feels that her trials in the integration of Central High, and her quest for equality, in general, separate her from Vince, and she begins to stop returning his calls. By the end of the book, she has peacefully separated herself from Vince without a big confrontation.</p>`

He ran for president in 1952 and won in a landslide. With civil rights being one of his principal ideas, he was quick to order a meeting with Governor Faubus of Arkansas when Faubus refused to comply with <em>Brown vs. Board of Education</em>. Faubus agreed to integration in the meeting but then turned a blind eye to a massive mob outside of Central High preventing the Little Rock Nine from entering, before sending the Arkansas National Guard in to "keep the peace". However, the Arkansas National Guard did more harm than good, so Eisenhower stepped in again and sent the 101st Airborne Division to protect the Little Rock Nine. The Screaming Eagles significantly lessened the taunting and abuse at Central High for the Little Rock Nine, though the help they could offer was limited. Inevitably, the 101st had to leave (to show that integration in Little Rock could be successful without military force), and when they did, The Little Rock Nine was exposed to more harassment and abuse than ever before.</p>`

In one case, she has the Little Rock Nine stay in her office out of fear that attending a pep rally will endanger them. She even decides to "escort the girls to the restroom and the cafeteria" to prevent the threats and violence directed at The Little Rock Nine. However, her morality is called into question on numerous occasions. In one instance, she lies to Minnijean about the date of the tryouts for The Christmas Show to prevent her from entering. She may have been trying to protect Minnijean, but either way, Minnijean was devastated. It is quite a pity that at the end of the book, as Melba consistently reports ramped-up abuse from segregationists to her, that she refuses to step in and denies that there is anything wrong.</p>`

When the Arkansas National Guard fail (they didn't even try) to protect The Little Rock Nine from abuse at Central High, Eisenhower calls in the Screaming Eagles to take control of the situation. Upon the 101st's arrival, The Little Rock Nine are finally protected: they're escorted to school in an armed car, and they have guards from the 101st follow them around in the halls. However, the 101st can't completely defend the Little Rock Nine from harassment. The Little Rock Nine's guards can come with them into the bathroom or the cafeteria, so as a result, the worst torment happens there. Even when the guards are present, they are only allowed to prevent the Little Rock Nine from being harmed physically. They can't intervene to stop the never-ending taunting and verbal abuse.</p>
            <p>However, the 101st is effective is drastically reducing the torment dished out by the segregationists. However, once everything seems as if it has settled down, Eisenhower attempts to pull the 101st out of Little Rock. The moment the 101st vacates Central High, attacks by segregationists sore to such a height that the 101st returns to Little Rock. They defend the Little Rock Nine for some time, but eventually, they are forced to go - as the integration wouldn't have been a success if it required military force to uphold.

Even when they are assigned to <em>specifically guard members of the Little Rock Nine</em> they ultimately stand by while taunts and kicks are flung at the people they're supposed to be guarding. On multiple occasions, Melba's guard would stand by aloofly while white students beat her again and again. In some instances, crazed segregationists bribe their way past the Arkansas National Guard to attack the Little Rock Nine.

Nevertheless, students still tried to tease, abuse, and even kill Melba when Danny wasn't there (they tried to burn her alive in a bathroom stall.) However, when Danny was there, protecting Melba was his top priority (unlike the Arkansas National Guard.)</p>
            <p>Furthermore, he thwarted two schemes to wound and possibly kill Melba. In the first scheme, a group of students threw a stick of dynamite at Melba from the top of a staircase. Danny quickly pushed Melba out of harm's way, stamped out the dynamite fuse, and handed it off to another soldier. When Melba tried to hide in "the shadow on the landing", Danny, worried that there would be another attack, instructed Melba, “You don’t have time to stop. Move out, girl.”</p>
            <p>In the second scheme, Melba's eyesight was threatened. A boy ambushed Melba and Danny and swiftly thrust acid at Melba's eyes.

When Danny eventually was instructed to leave, he couldn't bring himself to tell Melba directly, but right before he has to go, he tells Melba to take care of herself. Melba remains eternally grateful to Danny, writing in her diary: "I will always remember this man. How could I forget his name?

Marsha proceeds to make up a story about having to go to another friend's party, but when Melba debunks it, Marsha tells the truth: she and Melba's other friends are too afraid to come to Melba's house, as crazed segregationists could toss a firebomb or rock through the window of Melba's house at any time - or something even worse.

            <p>However, as the weeks go on, Link continues to send Melba important information about planned attacks on her. He reveals that his father takes him to meetings where segregationists plot how to take down the Little Rock Nine, and no one suspects that he would be feeding Melba information. To add to Melba's confusion about the integrity of Link, he asks Melba to testify that not all white students inside Central are bad and that things at Central High are getting better, to help reclaim funding for canceled extracurriculars. This isn't true, so this request leads Melba to wonder whether Link is using her. Ultimately, Melba's faith in Link is clarified when she sees how Link cares for his former caregiver, Nana Healey, who has contracted tuberculosis.</p>`

            body: `<p>Nana Healey, Link's former caregiver, is an old African-American woman who Link introduces to Melba near the end of <em>Warriors Don't Cry</em>. While never specifically stated in the book, Link may have introduced Nana Healey to Melba to show her that he cared about the African-American community. Link often visited and cared for Nana Healey, who had come down with a terrible cough ((Link thinks it's tuberculosis.) Melba assists Link in caring for Nana Healey and sends over a doctor to assess her condition. The prognosis is grim: without care in a hospital, she will die. Link does not have the money to send Nana Healey to a hospital, so she inevitably passes away on Link's graduation day, devastating him.</p>`

            body: `<p>Born in 1954, Ruby Bridges was one of the only students to integrate the New Orleans school system. She passed the difficult entrance exam established by the Orleans Parish School Board designed to keep schools segregated, and then went on to desegregate the kindergarten class at William Frantz Elementary School. When Ruby first attended William Frantz, all but one teacher refused to teach her, and some white students left the school altogether. Though the white students would eventually return to William Frantz, Ruby was still regularly threatened on her way to school and she was taught alone, separate from the other children for the entire year or kindergarten. Today, she heads the Ruby Bridges Foundation and has received the Presidential Citizens Medal for her contributions to integration and The Civil Rights movement as a whole.</p>`

In <em>Warriors Don't Cry</em>, he welcomes the Little Rock Nine back to Little Rock for the 30th anniversary of the integration of Central High. Six years later, he would go on to becomes President of The United States, where he slashed takes for low-income families, passed the controversial DOMA act (which has been repealed), and got impeached due to a sex scandal (though he was acquitted.)

He helped America recover from the Great Recession by passing revolutionary economic policies. Obama also began to take action against pollution and climate change when he prevented unsafe drilling from causing any more oil spills. One of his most significant achievements was the Affordable Care Act, also known as "Obamacare", which significantly reduced the cost of health insurance in America.</p>`

A powerful and persuasive orator, he endorsed a nonviolent approach to protests, correctly believing that through peaceful demonstrations, African Americans could claim the rights promised to them in the Constitution. He led many marches and protests across the nation, including the three marches on Selma that were protesting the unfair tests and qualifications that prevented African Americans from voting. He later helped organize the march on Washington, where he gave his famous I Have a Dream" speech to an audience of around 250,000 people. He continued campaigning for Civil Rights until April 4, 1968, where he was tragically assassinated by James Earl Ray. He was posthumously awarded the presidential medal of freedom, among other awards for his stunning contributions to the Civil Rights movement.</p>`

They backed up <em>Brown vs. Board of Education</em>, and after that, the NAACP went on to pursue multiple Civil Rights cases that pushed for the abolishment of segregation nationwide. Daisy Bates, the NAACP President of Arkansas, enveloped herself in helping the Little Rock Nine integrate Central. Several years later, the entire NAACP aided the effort to pass a comprehensive Civil Rights bill, which succeeded. Today, the NAACP continues to make the world a better place, by supporting LGBTQ+ rights, by pushing for environmental action, and of course, by supporting African American rights across the nation.</p>"

Melba describes seeing herself in statue form as "My God - it's me - me, with a ponytail, a young face, a tall, thin body clutching my books to my chest.

Early in <em>Warriors Don't Cry</em> Melba travels to Cincinnati to visit Clancey, and there she sees what life is like without segregation. She can suddenly eat at the same restaurants as white people, go to the movies with white people, and the white neighbors even invite her family over for dinner. Her respite from the brutality of segregation is cut short when her father calls, to inform her mother that Melba volunteered to go to Central High. After that, the remainder of Melba's vacation becomes a preparation for Melba's impending attendance at Central High. However, she always remembers how Cincinnati accepted her, and early in <em>Warriors Don't Cry</em>, Melba hopes "that integrating Central High school was the first step to making Little Rock just like Cincinnati, Ohio." </p>`

A mob initially formed outside the school to block the Little Rock Nine from entering, and when they did, crazed racists would sometimes break through the mob in an attempt to kill one of them (until the 101st came.) Throughout the year, students at Central High continue to torture the Little Rock Nine, going to such great lengths as to burn them, blind them, or even kill them. However, when the year comes to a close, eight of the original nine have made it through the school year ((Minnijean was expelled unfairly), and Ernest Green graduates successfully. The Little Rock Nine have survived the school year, but there are still many more steps to be taken. Across the coming years, Central High would integrate with decreasing levels of hostility, until integration could be declared a success - as there's an African-American student body president, Derrick Noble, when Melba returns to Central for the 30th anniversary of the initial integration.</p>"

She, along with twelve African-American families who also were in the same predicament, filed a lawsuit and the case went all the way to the Supreme Court. The case merged with several other similar cases before being brought before the Supreme Court - where persuasive arguments by Thurgood Marshall and evidence showing the brutal psychological effects of discrimination lead to a ruling that segregated schools were unconstitutional, and that all states were to integrate their schools as fast as possible. </p>"

        name: "Selma to Montogomery Marches",
        body: `<p>Alabama was the site of numerous Civil Rights protests and marches. The marchers protested the rigged "literacy tests" that Alabama required people to pass before they could vote - in reality, the tests were so vague that the answers were disregarded and the person administering the test would pass you if you were white, and if you were African American, would fail you. There were three attempted marches, all starting in Selma and ending in Montgomery.</p>
        <p> The first march was sparked when the leader of a smaller march was killed by authorities. Martin Luther King Jr. joined forces with director of the Voting Rights movement in Selma, James Bevel, to organize a march from Selma to Montogomery in protest of the "literacy tests" and bogus restrictions that prevented African Americans from voting. To ensure the safety of the marchers, Civil Rights leaders petitioned Governor Wallace of Alabama for the protection of the protestors. However, the governor instead declared the march a threat to public safety and announced that he would try to stop it. True to his word, hundreds of troops beat and wounded the marchers. 17 marches were wounded and 50 marches sustained lesser injuries.</p>
        <p>Grieving but not discouraged, The Civil Rights movement marched on. A second march was attempted, but the march was stopped by a restraining order that prevented the marchers from crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge to complete the march. Eventually, the marchers received a court order that allowed them to march from Selma to Montogomery unfettered, which they promptly did in the third and final march. Over 25,000 people (compared to the initial six thousand) arrived in Montgomery at the end of the march, where MLK gave the speech <em>How Long? Not Long.</em></p>`

They were again refused service, and they again refused to leave, working on homework while white people teased and harassed them. Every day, more and more students came to the sit-in, and still, they were refused service. Eventually, the sit-in swelled to over 300 people, and facing devastating losses, Woolworth agreed to desegregate.</p>`
